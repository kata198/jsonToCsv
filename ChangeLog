0.2.0 - Feb 28 2017
- Added support for multiple line items (+ operator) to be used in a single parse. A line will be generated for each instance of the inner-most line item, iterating both on inner and outers
- Improved parsing, validation, and error messages in formatStr parsing
- Cleanup "convertToCsv" to call "extractData" instead of being a near-copy
- Minor cleanups and improvements
- Lots of optimizations in both performance and memory utilization
- Support keys at any level, even outside the first line item.
