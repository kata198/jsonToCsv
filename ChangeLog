1.0.0 - Mar 13 2017
- Some various refactoring, reodering and labeling to better denote the public
vs private methods
- Supoort comments inline to the format str (useful for multi-line format
strings to document what each line is doing). Use # to mark the remainder of
the line as a comment.
- Add support for having no line items defined (like parsing a single record
into a single csv line)

- Support the RFC 4180 standard by default (quoting, newlines, commas in csvs
etc are all now supported)

  This includes: 
  * Changing default line endings (configurable) to CRLF
  * introducing the ability to quote field data. 

  By default, the dataToStr and convertToCsv methods will have the quoteFields
  param set to 'smart'. 
    This means it will scan the output data for newlines, carriage returns, or
    the provided separator value.
      If any of these are found, it will escape quotes to appear correctly in
      output per RFC 4180 and quote all data. 
      This will allow, by default, for all characters to be able to be
      represented in CSV format. 
      You can also set quoteFields to False or True to explicitly do or do
      not quote values.

- Some minor optimizations
- Removed "asList" to convertToCsv
- Lots of documentation updates/rewrites
- Rename ParseError to FormatStrParseError. The old name will be kept around
for a short time for compat reasons, and they can be used interchangably

0.2.1 - Mar 13 2017
- Fix issue where on multiple line item formats where a pre-line item was defined on an item with multiple iterations


0.2.0 - Feb 28 2017
- Added support for multiple line items (+ operator) to be used in a single parse. A line will be generated for each instance of the inner-most line item, iterating both on inner and outers
- Improved parsing, validation, and error messages in formatStr parsing
- Cleanup "convertToCsv" to call "extractData" instead of being a near-copy
- Minor cleanups and improvements
- Lots of optimizations in both performance and memory utilization
- Support keys at any level, even outside the first line item.
